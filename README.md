## E-Commerce Customer Analysis — Capstone Project

This project analyzes synthetic e-commerce customer data to uncover sales patterns, retention trends, and churn drivers. It combines SQL-based cohort and RFM analysis with logistic regression to predict churn modelled using Python's scikit-learn. A Tableau dashboard and a written report summarize the numbers and key insights. 

Dataset: E-Commerce Customer Data For Behavior Analysis [(sourced from Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/e-commerce-customer-for-behavior-analysis/data)
A synthetic dataset generated using the Python Faker library, designed to simulate real-world customer behavior in an e-commerce environment. It spans 3.5 years of purchase activity (2020-2023) with 250k total values. 
It contains transactional data including:
* Customer demographics (age, gender)
* Purchase history (dates, product categories, quantities, total spent)
* Payment methods and return information
* A binary churn indicator (0 = retained, 1 = churned). I assume that churn refers to account deletion or membership cancellation.

Chosen analysis types aim to provide value for the business in identifying high-value and at-risk customers, understand purchasing patterns and retention trends and predict customer churn to optimize retention strategies.
